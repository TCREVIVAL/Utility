TCR Utility Update 🚀 send-rewards-XLSX.js (send-rewards is old version for 1 wallet at a time)

Hello team! We’ve just updated the utility – now you can send rewards using an Excel file! 🎉

1 single transaction for all rewards 

🛠 Prerequisites:
Make sure you’ve already used our send-rewards.js file and understand how the process works.

📄 Steps to Use:

Step 1: Create an Excel file named recipients.xlsx
(Place it in the same folder as the JS code file)

Step 2: Add two columns:
address and amount

Step 3: Fill in the rows with wallet addresses and the LUNC amount you wish to send

Step 4: Save the file in the same folder where your JS file and terra.js are located
If you face issues, feel free to ask 

Step 5: Open Windows PowerShell and run:

node send-rewards-xlsx.js

Step 6: If successful, you’ll see the transaction hash and confirmation 🎯

Step 7: If you’re new, we highly recommend creating a test wallet and sending 1 LUNC first as a test. Once you're confident, go ahead with your real wallet ✅

🙋‍♂️ For any questions or help, feel free to reach out!
